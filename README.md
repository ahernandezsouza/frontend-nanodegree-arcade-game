# The Frog Princess

The Frog Princess is trying to recover her life-gems from the Beatles, her sworn enemies (since Frogs eat them). She has to recover all the gems without falling to the river and getting dragged to the beggining [here](http://ahernandezsouza.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)).

In the game you'll control our heroine, the Frog Princess!

Her name is **Sophie**.  You'll use the **arrow keys** to move Sophie around the map, trying to get the **gems**!

Each one is worth **50 points**!

You must avoid the...

**...Beatle Soliders!**  

The **water** won't kill you, but the river takes you back to the start (not fun).

You can choose a bigger number of tiles for greater difficulty **(e for easy, h for hard)**. If you get to **350 points** you win the game!

I hope you enjoy the game!!
